        <p>This style of fried chicken comes from the southern city of Hat Yai, however it is popular all over Thailand.</p>
        <H2>Ingredients</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ lb chicken wings</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1–2 cilantro roots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>heaping 1⁄4 tsp black peppercorns</li>
            <li>heaping ¼ tsp white peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 ½ Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li> 
            <li>½ tsp salt (if marinating overnight, cut down to ¼ tsp)</li>
            <li>¼ – ⅓ cup water (If the chicken is already wet from washing, add only ¼ cup)</li>
            <li>1⁄2 cup thinly sliced shallots (for fried shallots)</li>
            <li>1⁄4 – 1⁄2 cup rice flour</li>
            <li>Sticky rice for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean and slice the shallots very evenly, and into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Lay the sliced shallots out on a plate lined with a paper towel. Sprinkle salt over the shallot, you can be quite generous as you want to make sure all pieces are salted. Let the shallots sit, uncovered while you prepare other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Before frying the shallots, take a piece of paper towel and press it onto the shallots to absorb all the water the shallots have given off.</li>
            <li>Add about 1″ of oil to a pot, and heat it over medium heat. Add all the shallots into the oil (you don’t need to wait to the oil to get hot) and keep heating until the shallots are bubbling gently all over. Reduce heat to LOW, then keep frying, stirring constantly, until they turn golden brown. </li>
            <li>Once the shallots are golden brown AND the bubbling has subsided, remove from oil with a slotted skimmer and drain on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Using a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic, cilantro roots, and peppercorns into a fine paste.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture into a zip-top bag (or a bowl)  and add the salt, sugar, soy sauce, water, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and let marinade for 2 hours. In between, flip the bag halfway through or stir the chicken a couple of times (if you are using a bowl).</li>

            <li>In the same pot you used to fry the shallots, add more oil so you have about 2″ of oil. Heat until the oil reaches 350°F.</li>
            <li>While you wait for the oil to heat, take the chicken out of the bag and put them into a large mixing bowl. Add the rice flour, ¼ cup at a time, and stir until you have a thin batter coating the chicken.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken for 4-6 minutes or until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken and fried shallot crumbs from oil, and serve with sticky rice.</li>
        </ol>
